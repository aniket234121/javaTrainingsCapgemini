# Functional Interfaces
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method (SAM â€” Single Abstract Method). 

The presence of a single abstract method ensures that the interface can be used with lambda expressions. In other words, functional interfaces serve as the target type for lambda expressions and method references.

There can be any no. of default and static methods in functional Interfaces.

There are various types of functional interfaces.
